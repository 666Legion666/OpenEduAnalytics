# Data Sources

This package combines multiple data sources which were identified through research as strongly related to absenteeism: 
* School Information System (SIS): School, grade, and roster data
* Barriers to students: Transportation data, distance from school, school changes, student illness
* School experiences: School suspension, disciplinary, behavior, and learning outcome data
* Engagement data: School attendance, digital engagement

This package can use several [OEA Modules](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules) to help ingest data sources that are typically used to understand patterns of chronic absenteeism (see below for list of relevant OEA modules).  

| OEA Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ed-Fi Data Standards](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Education_Data_Standards/Ed-Fi) | For typical Student Information System (SIS) data, including detailed student attendance, demographic, digital activity, and academic data. |
| [Microsoft Digital Engagement](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Microsoft_Data) | Such as M365 [Education Insights Premium](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Microsoft_Data/Microsoft_Education_Insights_Premium), or [Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Microsoft_Data/Microsoft_Graph) data. |
| [Digital Learning Apps and Platforms](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Digital_Learning_Apps_and_Platforms) | [Clever](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Digital_Learning_Apps_and_Platforms/Clever) for learning ap data and [iReady](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Digital_Learning_Apps_and_Platforms/iReady) for language and math assessments and learning activities. |
