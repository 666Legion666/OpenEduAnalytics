## Pseudonymization of End User Identifiable Information
To protect studentsâ€™ identity and comply with GDPR and CCPA requirements, it is required that end user identifiable information like names, email addresses, etc., are pseudonymized. The [OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework/synapse) incorporates notebooks and pipelines for pseudonymizing columns in the data sets used for this package. 

The OEA pseudonymization operations are:
- **hash-no-lookup or hnl:** This means that the lookup can be performed against a different table, so no lookup is needed
- **hash or h:** This will hash the column and create a lookup table as well
- **mask or m:** This will mask the column and will not create a lookup table
- **no-op or x:** No operation will be performed so the column will remain as it is
