> We provide sample Student Information System data sets as part of this kit, which you can use. Feel free to generate your own test data that will suit the new module you are creating. When generating new test data, it is important to make sure that it aligns with existing data or new data you plan to create so it becomes easier to join the tables and create relationships for PowerBI visualization. For example, using the same students and same schools. To make this process seamless, we recommend integrating OEA standardized schemas. Common education data standards like Caliper, Ed-Fi and SIF allow for data solutions to be built on a common analytical foundation and for a ‘plug and play’ approach to combining data from multiple sources.  [Learn more about how to integrate OEA schemas in your new module](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas).

In this readme file, describe the test data and provide a data dictionary using the table provided below.

# Test data
This module includes artificially generated data which matches the format of the [insert number of tables ingested in module] [insert module name] [insert type of data defined by the data source] (e.g. “two Clever Participation Reports.”)
-	[Insert name of Table 1]: [Insert brief description of the data contained in the table.]
- [Insert name of Table 2]: [Insert brief description of the data contained in the table.]
[Insert any further details on the data source.]


## Data dictionary
[Insert name of Table 1 with a hyperlink to the test data provided.]
|Column Name   |Data Type        |Description  |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
|Column 1  | Data Type (e.g. Date, String, Integer, Timestamp, etc.)      |Description |
|Column 2  | Data Type (e.g. Date, String, Integer, Timestamp, etc.)      |Description |

[Insert screenshot of test data provided, with a header (refer to the [Clever Module](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Clever/test_data) as an example).]

Additional notes: [Insert any additional notes about the data within that table for anyone reviewing the module.]
