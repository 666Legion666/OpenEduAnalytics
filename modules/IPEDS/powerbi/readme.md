# PowerBI template

The IPEDS PowerBI template consists of 7 pages:

1. **Institution Selection Page:** The Institution Selection page provides the foundation for data shown on subsequent pages. Users must select their focus institution in the first box. Use the search box to limit results for easier selection.Users must then select peer comparison institutions in the center box. Use the slicers and search box to limit results for easier selection. Users can return to this page at any time to change the selected peers; data on subsequent pages will update automatically.  

- Primary Institution: primary institutions from the list provided
- Peer Institutions: peer institutions from the list provided

2. **Institution Summary Page:** The focus of this page is to provide a holistic view of the intersectionality of the key area of every institution (Admissions, Enrollment, Tuition, Revenue, and Student Success). This view provides a visually guided framework for how key stakeholders at every level of the institution can engage in a meaning conversation of data trends related to key strategic areas.  The most currently available eight years of IPEDS data are shown for each metric. 
- Applicants, Admitted, Enrolled: applicants, admits, and enrollment by year
- First Time in College Enrollment: first-time, full-time enrollment by year
- Published in-state tuition & fees: published in-state tuition and fees by year

First-time student (undergraduate) |  A student who has no prior postsecondary experience (except as noted below) attending any institution for the first time at the undergraduate level. This includes students enrolled in academic or occupational programs. It also includes students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer term, and students who entered with advanced standing (college credits earned before graduation from high school). Students enrolled in courses for credit and recognized by the institution as seeking a degree, certificate, or other formal award. High school students also enrolled in postsecondary courses for credit are not considered degree/certificate-seeking. Undergraduate - A student enrolled in a 4- or 5-year bachelor's degree program, an associate's degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate.

|Full-time first-time degree/certificate seeking undergraduates | Full-time first-time degree/certificate seeking undergraduate men and women enrolled for credit in the fall of the academic year. |
| Full-time equivalent fall enrollment | This variable is derived from the enrollment by race/ethnicity section of the fall enrollment survey. The full-time equivalent of the institution's part-time enrollment is estimated and then added to the full-time enrollment of the institution. This formula has been used to produce the full-time equivalent enrollment that is published annually in the Digest of Education Statistics. The full-time equivalent of part-time enrollment is estimated by multiplying the part-time enrollment by factors that vary by control and level of institution and level of student. |
| Full-time retention rate | The full-time retention rate is the percent of the (fall full-time cohort from the prior year minus exclusions from the fall full-time cohort) that re-enrolled at the institution as either full- or part-time in the current year. |
| Graduate enrollment | Total graduate men and women enrolled for credit in the fall of the academic year.
