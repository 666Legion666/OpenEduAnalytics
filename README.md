Open Education Analytics (OEA) is a fully [open-sourced](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/license) data integration and analytics framework for the education sector, as well as catalogs of assets contributed by customers and partners around the world - for K-12 as well as Higher Education.

The goal is to **empower the ecosystem** by:

1) making it easy to setup a modern lakehouse in Azure
1) facilitating the sharing of common assets (data pipelines, transformation scripts, dashboards, etc) 

<br/><br/>
