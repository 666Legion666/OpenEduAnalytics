# OpenEduAnalytics
                                                                                                                        
### Overview
OpenEduAnalytics is a fully open-sourced ([Creative Commons](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/LICENSE) and [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/LICENSE-CODE)) data integration and analytics solution for the education sector built on [Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics/).

Please be aware that this is an early alpha release of the assets for building the reference architecture and assets demonstrating its use.
The underlying Azure platform services are mature and well documented, but this set of assets utilizing those platform services is very much a work in progress and comes with no warranties nor SLA's, etc.

That being said, this effort is far enough along to serve as a great starting point to quickly provision the Azure resources needed for the implementation of a reference architecture for the ingestion, processing, and visualization of education data in a data lake.

And once you have your starting point, it's a matter of iterating and optimizing as you evolve your design and build out the solution you need.
We look forward to growing this set of assets in conjunction with you - our customers and partners.

### What you need
To setup an environment with OpenEduAnalytics, you'll need:
* an Azure subscription (if you don't have an Azure subscription, you can set up a [free subscription here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free))
* role assignment of "Owner" on the Azure subscription you're using

### Setup
You can setup a fully functional test environment with a test data set in 3 steps:
1) Open cloud shell in your azure subscription (use ctrl+click on the button below to open in a new page)\
[![Launch Cloud Shell](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com/bash)
1) Download this repo to your azure clouddrive \
`cd clouddrive`\
`git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics`
1) Run the setup script like this (substitute "mysuffix" with your preferred suffix, which must be less than 13 characters and can only contain letters and numbers - this will be used as a suffix in the naming of provisioned resources): \
`./OpenEduAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix`

(You can refer to this [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QnRPHK1vXg) for a quick walkthrough of this process)

### Additional setup options
By default, the setup script provisions Azure resources in the East US region, but you can choose other locations as well (eg, westus, northeurope).\
For example:\
`./OpenEduAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix northeurope`

You can also choose to have the script create security groups to facilitate the use of role based access control to the data lake.\
If you are running the setup for an environment in which you have Global Admin permissions on the tenant, and you want to have security groups provisioned, you can invoke the setup script like this:\
`./OpenEduAnalytics/setup.sh mysuffix eastus true`

### Additional info
For more complete details on the installation and usage of the Open Edu Analytics base architecture and test environment, see [Open Edu Analytics Solution Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/docs/OpenEduAnalyticsSolutionGuide.pdf)
